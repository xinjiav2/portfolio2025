## Player Leaderboard and Settings
Make a lesson and code around a leaderboard.  Explain or try ideas so they can be adapted to the Teacher's project. 

Show the leaderboard on the start and game-over screen. Use local storage to record gameplay sessions, automatically at first. Time and points by level could be used as stats.

Allow players to review and filter the leaderboard.

Start Screen
Add features to start screen(s) to allow things like â€¦
