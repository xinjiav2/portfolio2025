## Parallax and Scrolling Effects
Make a lesson and code around the look and feel of the Game, things like Parallax scrolling and assets and how they look and feel.  Integrate ideas so they can be adapted by the Teacher project.  Add elements to improve screens and characters.  Below are a couple of ideas, but there should be many more.

- Crossover reviews.  The Animation team and your team can should coordinate together, to minimize overlap.  

- Use a transition effect to smoothly move from the start screen to the game screen, etc.

- Overlaying Backgrounds
  - Implement a dual-layered background system where the primary background is static, and a passive background moves to create a parallax effect.
  - Adjust the opacity or blending mode to avoid shadows of the player moving over the screen.  Discuss how this works.

- Association with Character Movement
  - Synchronize the screen scrolling speed with the player's movement speed.
  - Consider incorporating easing functions for a smoother scrolling effect.

- Style.  Coordinate the styles of screens and characters.   For instance, goombas are way overused and don't fit the theme.  Backgrounds on most levels are very simple and little thought was put into the Parallax look.

- Messaging system.   The messages do not appear to be synchronized to levels and were implemented in an unorthodox fashion.  Redesign the messaging system and make sure it is not in the way of gameplay on smaller screens, ie Chromebooks.

- Transition Screen
  - The start screen could have things to select levels for the Game or Competition in Multiplayer (Groups)
  - The end screen could be more focused on results automatically.
