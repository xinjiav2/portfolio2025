## Player interactions 
Make a lesson and code around the player.  Integrate ideas so they can be adapted by the Teacher project, perhaps as a different level(s).

Ideally, some interactions would be added to the platformer game.  Or, there could be a new level to the game that is more has more RPG-like experience.  Remember, how the dog interacts with the Monkey in Game1x.
