## Binary, Data, Data Structures, Data Abstraction (ASCII, Unicode, Color Codes)

Algorithms, Data, Data Structures, and Visualization can go together.  To start this warmup project, use Classroom and CPT ***requirements*** to venture into Algorithms.  This blog is a collection of binary, data and data structures and should be a great CPT practice project.

- ***Explore a topic in Computer Science manner*** (research, jupyter notebooks, frontend / backend coding)
- Tour the Code.  ***Use [Binary Frontend Code](thttps://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher//c4.4/2023/09/14/javascript-binary-U2-1.html)*** to get you started. <mark>Obtain code form teacher project drag and drop _posts/2023-09-14-javascript-binary-U2-1.ipynb to your project and Debug</mark>
- This Tech Talk will introduce requirements and finish with required ***hacks***.   Consider this blog and Binary Frontend Code as part of your research.

## Math in Binary

Learn binary by bitwise operators and more.  Shifting bits is a common computer operation and does wonderful things in math like multiply and divide.  Last bit always determines odd or even.
Look for shift on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_bitwise.asp)

### Logic of Shift

Explore right and left shifts with binary numbers.  

- In an arithmetic shift, the bits that are shifted out of either end are discarded.  You need to be aware of how many bits you have to avoid overflow in math operations.
- In a left arithmetic shift, zeros are shifted in on the right.

### Understand binary Numbers by elaboration of Shift (2^^0, 2^^1, 2^^2)

How does the Power of 2 work?  What is a binary number?  What is Base2, Base10, Base16.

- This example uses an 8-bit register.  Math can be represented in much in many more bits, 32 bits or 2 bytes is common for integer in modern computer languages.
- Most Significant Bit (MSB), least (LSB)
- This example shows negative and positive numbers, using technique called Twos Complement.
- In the first case, the leftmost digit was shifted past the end of the register, and a new 0 was shifted into the rightmost position. Positive Multiply.
- In the second case, the rightmost 1 was shifted out, and a new 1 was copied into the leftmost position, preserving the sign of the number. Negative Divide, this example obviously needs more study.

### UI Concept/Design

Conceptualize a UI that will illustrate binary and decimal.  In learning these concepts, it is best to code and example to illustrate what is happening.

- *n Right Shifts (divides by 2^n); n Left Shifts (multiplies by 2^n)*
- Add buttons for  "<<"   and  " >>"

## ASCII and Unicode

Computers represent more than Math.  Mostly everyone is familiar with the characters on a keyboard and Emojis.  These are all represented in binary, the data abstraction being the characters we visualize. ðŸ˜‚

### Character Data Abstraction

How are characters stored?  How many bits do they take?  

- ASCII is 8 bits, it generally represent keys on keyboard.  Look up ASCII Table.
- Unicode can be UTF-8, 16 or 32, each representing bits.  ASCII is preserved in Unicode.
- ASCII - 7 bits, extended to 8 bits with Unicode
- UTF-8
- UTF-16
- UTF-32
![unicode]({{site.baseurl}}/images/binary/sample_unicode.png)
*Sample of Unicode characters.*

### Character Concept/Design

The ASCII value in picture should be changed based off of the bits in evaluation you are doing.  Bits displayed, label, and evaluation would be specific to evaluation type:

*Original ASCII*

## Color Codes

Pixels are little dots on Monitors and TVs that make up the display. Each pixel has an Red Green and Blue value (RGB).   All pictures we see or take are composed of RGB using a density measurement.  These are stored and then represented by digitally or in print.

- Monitors
  - 1280 x 1024 Super-eXtended Graphics Array (SXGA)
  - 1366 x 768 High Definition (HD)
  - 1600 x 900 High Definition Plus (HD+)
  - 1920 x 1080 Full High Definition (FHD)
  - 1920 x 1200 Wide Ultra Extended Graphics Array (WUXGA)
- TVs
  - 4K Ultra HD: The term 4K means the screen is about 4,000 pixels wide. ...
  - 1080p (Full HD): This resolution is 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. ...
  - 720p (HD Ready): This is mostly found on smaller TVs, and it has a resolution of 1,280 x 720.
- Camera
|Sensor Resolution (megapixels)|Typical Image Resolution (pixels)|
|2.16|1800 x 1200|
|3.9|2272 x 1704|
|5.0|2592 x 1944|
|7.1|3072 x 2304|
|8.0|3264 x 2448|
|10.0|3648 x 2736|
|12.1|4000 x 3000|
|14.7|4416 x 3312|
|21.0|5616 x 3744|

### A Color code is a 24 bit abstraction

There are 8 bits for Red, 8 bits for Blue, and 8 bits for Green.

|Name|Hex Code|RGB Code|
|Black|#000000|rgb(0, 0, 0)|
|Red|#FF0000|rgb(255, 0, 0)|
|Maroon|#800000|rgb(128, 0, 0)|
|Yellow|#FFFF00|rgb(255, 255, 0)|

![color]({{site.baseurl}}/images/binary/color_code.png)
*255 * 255 * 255 combinations of R, G, B*

### Color UI Design

## Logic Gates

The fundamentals of all decisions in computers is made by logic gates.  These gates are visualized by permuting 1 and 0 across many different types of decisions.  The result is an expression that evaluated to 1 or 0.   These are called Truth Tables.

### Logic Gates can be simulated with 2 bits

Look for bitwise operators on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_bitwise.asp)

### Logic UI Concept

Visual concept of logic gates

- Establish check boxes for A / B on and off
- Show result of Boolean Expression using Gate visual

### Logic of Logic Gates

A logic gate can have two inputs (a,b) and by how changing these inputs it impacts the output(c).

- There are four possible inputs:
  - 0 0
  - 0 1
  - 1 0
  - 1 1
- Understanding the output enables us to understand a logical expressions.  All outputs are routed in Logic Gates (similar to how a language is routed in Latin).
  - AND is true for 1 1; NAND is true opposite of AND 0 0, 0 1, 1 0
  - OR is true for 1 1, 0 1, 1 0, NOR is true opposite of OR 0 0
  - XOR is true for 0 1, 1 0

### Practical Application

Logic gates are used everywhere

## Unsigned Addition

Here we are requesting 3 rows of bits to simulate Math. This could be done with 4, 8, or 16 bits.

### Initial UI Implementation

### Unsigned Addition Exanoke

## Signed Addition

Integers in most languages are int8, int16, int32, or int64. They typically reserve left most bit for sign.

### Common concept for Integer Math

![pos]({{site.baseurl}}/images/binary/binary/integer_math_pos.png)
*Positive number*

### Basic concept, but not typically used

![neg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/binary/integer_math_neg.png)
*Negative number*

### Inverting numbers, twos complement

![twos]({{site.baseurl}}/images/binary/twos_complement.png)
*Two's complement allows adding for signed and unsigned numbers*

Basic concept is to invert/negate bits to produce negative. This allows numbers to be added together for expected results. >> and >>> have been adapted to handle signed and zero filled shifting.

## Hacks

Data, Data Structures, Algorithm, and Visualization work together.  Data helps supply an interests/topic to an algorithm.  It will be expected that you build topics above into your team mini project.

- This project will be two weeks long and will incorporate Ideation, Design, Feature Implementation, Integration, Test Complete phases.
- Add "Science" into your process*** (research, jupyter notebook, and ultimately running application)
- Topics used for teaching, not listed in this blog need to be approved by Teacher.  
- Topics need to focus on data ideas from Unit 2 of AP Classroom.
- Visualization require style using GitHub Pages Theme techniques (SASS)
