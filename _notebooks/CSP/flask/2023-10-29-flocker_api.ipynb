    "## Using Postman\n",
    "\n",
    "Postman is a powerful tool for testing APIs. It allows developers to send HTTP requests to their APIs, inspect responses, and automate testing. Here are some key points and steps to guide your discussion on Postman:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Postman Concepts**:\n",
    "   - Postman can be used to test individual endpoints of the backend API without needing the frontend to be fully developed.\n",
    "   - This allows developers to ensure that the backend logic is working correctly before integrating it with the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backend / Frontend are independent until Integration**:\n",
    "   - Developers can verify that each API endpoint behaves as expected, which simplifies debugging and ensures that the backend is robust before integration with the frontend.\n",
    "   - Postman can help in designing and documenting APIs.\n",
    "     - By defining the expected inputs and outputs for each endpoint, developers can establish clear requirements for the frontend.\n",
    "     - This ensures that both frontend and backend teams are aligned on the API specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Postman Demo**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open Postman**:\n",
    "   - Launch the Postman application on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a New Request**:\n",
    "   - Click on the \"New\" button and select \"Request\".\n",
    "   - Enter a name for your request and choose a collection to save it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set the Request Method and URL**:\n",
    "   - Select the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from the dropdown menu.\n",
    "   - Enter the URL of the API endpoint you want to test (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8087/api/jokes`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add Request Body (for POST/PUT requests)**:\n",
    "   - If you are sending data to the server (e.g., for a POST or PUT request), add the request body in the \"Body\" tab.\n",
    "   - Select the appropriate format (e.g., JSON) and enter the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Send the Request**:\n",
    "   - Click the \"Send\" button to send the request to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Inspect the Response**:\n",
    "   - Review the response returned by the server in the \"Response\" section.\n",
    "   - Check the status code, headers, and body to ensure that the API is behaving as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Save the Request**:\n",
    "   - Save the request in a collection for future use and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing Frontend in Different Parts**: Use Postman to test individual backend endpoints.\n",
    "- **Independent Testing**: Verify backend functionality independently before integration.\n",
    "- **API Design and Documentation**: Use Postman to design and document APIs, establishing clear requirements for the frontend.\n",
    "- **Demonstration**: Follow the steps to create, send, and inspect requests using Postman.\n"
