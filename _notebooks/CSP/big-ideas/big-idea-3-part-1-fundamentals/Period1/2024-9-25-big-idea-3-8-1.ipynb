Modify the code and implement a feature that asks the user if they are a student. If yes is answered, allow a 20 percent discount off of the original 10 dollar ticket. If no is answered, keep the price the same. Make sure it is able to handle invalid responses such as responses other than \"yes\" or \"no\" by prompting the user to answer again with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\"\n",
