    "title: CSP Period 4 Unit 3.7.4 Nested Conditionals Javascript Hacks\n",
    "description: In this lesson on nested conditionals in Javascript, students will explore how to create decision-making structures that involve multiple layers of conditions. By learning how to nest if, elif, and else statements, they will be able to write more precise and complex programs where one condition is checked only after another condition is met. The lesson will include hands-on exercises to help students understand when and how to apply nested conditionals for better control flow and logical clarity in their code.\n",
