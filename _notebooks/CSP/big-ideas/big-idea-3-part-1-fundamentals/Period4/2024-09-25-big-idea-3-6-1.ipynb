    "title: CSP Period 4 Unit 3.6.1 Conditionals in Python \n",
    "description: In this lesson, students will learn how to use if-else statements in Python to make decisions in their code. They will discover how to use if to check if something is true, else for what happens if it's not true, and elif for more choices. Students will also learn how to combine conditions using and, or, and not. By the end of the lesson, they will be able to write simple programs that make decisions based on different situations. \n",
