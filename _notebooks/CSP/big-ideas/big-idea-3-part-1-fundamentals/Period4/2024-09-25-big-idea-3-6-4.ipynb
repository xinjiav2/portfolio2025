    "title: CSP Period 4 Unit 3.6.4 Conditionals in JavaScript Hacks\n",
    "description: In this lesson, students will practice using if-else statements in JavaScript through interactive exercises. They will work on solving problems that require making decisions in their code based on different conditions. The exercises will cover how to use if, else if, and else statements to handle multiple outcomes. Students will also practice combining conditions with logical operators like && (and), || (or), and ! (not). By the end of the lesson, students will have improved their ability to write programs that respond dynamically based on different scenarios. \n",
