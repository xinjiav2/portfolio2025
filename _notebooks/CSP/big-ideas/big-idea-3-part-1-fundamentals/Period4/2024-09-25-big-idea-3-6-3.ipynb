    "title: CSP Period 4 Unit 3.6.4 Conditionals in Python Hacks\n",
    "description: In this lesson, students will practice using if-else statements in Python through a series of hands-on exercises. They will solve problems that require them to make decisions in their code based on different conditions. These exercises will cover checking conditions with if, handling multiple outcomes with elif, and providing fallback options with else. Students will also practice combining conditions using and, or, and not to create more complex decision-making programs. By the end of the lesson, students will be more confident in using conditionals to solve real-world problems. \n",
