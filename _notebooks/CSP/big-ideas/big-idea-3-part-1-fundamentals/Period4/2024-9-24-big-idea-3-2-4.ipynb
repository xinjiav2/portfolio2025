    "Lists are similar to its name, it's a variable that equals a list of objects inside of it. For example, if I want to make a list of ingredients, I can make ingredients equal something inside these \"[]\". Inside these brackets, you can put different objects inside of it and print out the list to be able to get everything inside that list.\n",

    "## Lists with Indexs:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to print out specific parts inside that list, we can do that by printing out the index. From the index, it goes from index (0) -> index (1) -> index (2) -> etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I wanted to print out the words \"eggs\" only from a list, I would mention its index inside the list AND the list, and print it out:\n",

    "## Example:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Multiple Indexs In A List:\n",
    "If you want to get multiple indexes from the same list without making multiple print statements/etc. you can use a \":\" to scale it from the starting point, to how many objects it should contain. For example,\n",

    "## Appends\n",
    "\n",
    "(.append) is usually used to add something to a list, either in a specific part or just at the end of it. After the (.append) you use \"()\" and something inside of the parantheses to make something added to the list. For example:\n",
