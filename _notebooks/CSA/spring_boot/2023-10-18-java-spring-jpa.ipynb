    "\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Refers to the capability of an object to be stored in a database and retrieved later.\n",
    "- **API**: Provides methods to perform operations such as storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "JPA simplifies database programming by allowing developers to work with Java objects rather than SQL statements. It abstracts the database interactions and provides a standardized way to manage relational data in Java applications.\n",

    "- **Derived Queries**: Simplify the process of writing database queries by using method naming conventions.\n",
