    "APIs build programmatic interactions between applications, people, and businesses.  They are designed around sharing data and executing pre-defined processes.  Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA reduce time for development; developers implement POJOs and JPA access layers; Spring hanldes the rest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An API allows you to request and receive data from the system. A POJO is the foundation for making an Entity that is turned into a Database.  The Java Persistent API (JPA) allows the database to be queried and updated.    \n",
